# Bellman_Ford_and_Dijkstra_algorithm_CPP

This is the final project in the Algorithms course.
The purpose of the project is to write a program in the CPP language, which solves in several ways the problem of the minimum distances from a single origin
For a single target in directed graphs, according to Bellman Ford's algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm, and calculate the time
Running the various solutions.
